Hello, it will be my birdday soon. Unfortunately, this year I cannot have you over to eat cake and play boardgames. <br />
However, i would love to hear from you and hangout. We could play board games, dominion, among us or just chat! <br />
I will be online on <b>January 2nd</b> from 7pm-8.30pm EST / 4pm - 5.30pm PST  (This is equivalent to Jan 3, 11AM - 12.30PM ACT / 5:30am - 7:00am IST). <br />

Join at <a href="https://meet.google.com/cqz-fzxm-gxq">this link</a> for as little or as long as you like. Don't feel the need to stay for the full duration or excuse yourself.<br />
If you want a reminder <a href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NGZpbTNlYTM1a3U2NHJibHQ0YWptdnI1c2IgemFmYXJhbGkuYWhtZWRAbQ&tmsrc=zafarali.ahmed%40gmail.com">add it to your calendar.</a> <br />
