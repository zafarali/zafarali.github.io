Hello, it will be my birdday soon. Unfortunately, this year I cannot have you over to eat cake and play boardgames. <br />
However, i would love to hear from you and hangout. We could play board games, dominion, among us or just chat! <br />
I am online. Join at <a href="https://meet.google.com/cqz-fzxm-gxq">this link</a> for as little or as long as you like. Don't feel the need to stay for the full duration or excuse yourself.<br />
I will also be available on my bday on January 3rd, if you just want to call, chat or message :)
