# Hi, I'm Zaf!

## I am currently an MSc student at the [Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University where I work with neural networks.

## I love talking and learning about machine learning, so if you want to chat [contact me](http://www.twitter.com/zafarali)!

My interests include active and meta-learning, graph convoloutional neural networks and applications of deep learning to genomics. 

I am [Sri Lankan](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka) and currently live in [Montr&eacute;al.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Montreal,+QC/)
