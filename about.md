# Who is Zaf?

#### *Critical thinker. Science afficianado. Urban Explorer and Multipotentialite.*


Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to know more about the world. At university I have been
  exposed to the tools that will actually help me to **predict** the world.
  My current mission in life is to learn everything about [data driven decision making.](https://github.com/zafarali/explore-intelligence)

I am a casual cook, and known for the best [Sri Lankan Parippu](https://www.google.ca/search?espv=2&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enLK523LK523&amp;q=sri+lankan+parippu&amp;oq=sri+lankan+parippu&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i7i30l2j0j0i7i30j0l4j0i30j0i5i30.2632.3786.0.3967.11.11.0.0.0.1.130.966.9j2.11.0.msedr...0...1c.1.62.serp..1.10.896.WoOXrLaTM7E) at McGill.

I like to run and occasionally take [photographs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zafarali).

I am [Sri Lankan](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka) and currently live in [Montr&eacute;al.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Montreal,+QC/)
