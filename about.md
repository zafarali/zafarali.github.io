# Hi, I'm Zaf!

## I am currently a Research Developer/Engineer at [DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com). I graduated with an MSc from McGill University where I worked at both the [Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) and at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/).

My research interests are mainly related to reinforcement learning. I love talking and learning about machine learning, so if you want to chat [contact me](http://www.twitter.com/zafarali)!

I am [Sri Lankan](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka) and currently live in [Montr&eacute;al.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Montreal,+QC/)
