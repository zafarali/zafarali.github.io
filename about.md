# Hi, I'm Zafarali!

I am [Sri Lankan](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Sri+Lanka) where I grew up, I then lived in [Montr&eacute;al.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Montreal,+QC/) for 10 years before moving to the [Bay Area](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nXUW5ipsvLH41of6A). 

You can find me zipping around San Francisco on my Brompton folding bicycle and or [waiting for the Caltrain writing my blog](https://writing.zafarali.me/baybybrompton). I also perform improv whenever I can. 

I am currently a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com). I graduated with an MSc from McGill University where I worked at both the [Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) and at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/).
